# **Cosmere**  

When I started writing this post, it was about a quotes and lines from movies and books. 
Then midway through, I realized that I had a lot of quotes from Brandon Sanderson's works, and I didn't want to exclude some of them.
So now this is a post about my favourite quotes from all of the Cosmere - most notebly from the first 3 Stormlight Archive books and from the Era One Mistborn series.

### Mistborn

Starting strong with some of the best Kelsier quotes.

<Quote>
<div slot="quote">But you can't kill me, Lord Tyrant. I represent that one thing you've never been able to kill, no matter how hard you try. I am hope.</div>
</Quote>

The following two quotes are one of my favourite ones, and think that they give you so much insight into the character of the Kelsier.
How despite the stuggle and pain he was always positive.
<Quote>
<div slot="quote">He smiled despite the grief he felt at the deaths of his men; he smiled because that was what he did. That was how he proved to the Lord Ruler-and to himself-that he wasn't beaten.</div>
</Quote>
<Quote>
<div slot="quote">When you remember me, please remember that. Remember to smile.</div>
</Quote>

Another one of my favorite Cosmere quotes is this one, that I don't see a lot of people talking about because the scene itself wasn't as hyped as some of the other great quotes these books have.
> *Let them see my weakness, and let them see me overcome it.*

This is when Kelsier is leading Yeden and the troops into their cavern stronghold. 
Especially with him immediately struggling within himself and fighting through anyways, and joking with Ham once he got through as if it hadn't happened.
It shows a lot about Kelsier, and just resonates with me more than a lot of the 'cooler' quotes do. This


> Our belief is often strongest when it should be weakest. That is the nature of hope.

> Men rarely see their own actions as unjustified.

> The man who wants you to trust him is the one you must fear the most.




### Stormlight Archive

Starting with probably the most iconic quote. 
<Quote>
<div slot="quote">
Life before Death. Strength before Weakness. Journey before Destination.
</div>
</Quote>


The following group is a collection of Kaladin's quotes.
> Somebody has to start. Somebody has to step forward and do what is right, because it is right.

> Life breaks us, Teft. Then we fill the cracks with something stronger.

> ‘I will protect even those I hate,’ Kaladin whispered through bloody lips. ‘So long as it is right.‘

<Quote>
<div slot="quote">‘You sent him to the sky to die, assassin,’ Kaladin said, Stormlight puffing from his lips, ‘but the sky and the winds are mine. I claim them, as I now claim your life.‘</div>
<div slot="author">Kaladin, Words of Radiance</div>
</Quote>

The last one was more of a hype line, than a inspirational quote, but I think it is a great one.
Here are some wize words from various characters in the series.

<Quote>
<div slot="quote">Words are where most change begins.</div>
<div slot="author">Shallan Davar, Words of Radiance</div>
</Quote>

<Quote>
<div slot="quote">I will protect those I hate, even if the one I hate most is myself.</div>
<div slot="author">Teft, Oathbringer</div>
</Quote>

<Quote>
<div slot="quote">In turn, the only way to live without failure is to be of no use to anyone. Trust me, I’ve practiced</div>
<div slot="author">Wit, Oathbringer</div>
</Quote>

<Quote>
<div slot="quote">All stories told have been told before. We tell them to ourselves, as did all men who ever were. And all men who ever will be. The only things new are the names.</div>
<div slot="author">Wit, Words of Radiance</div>
</Quote>

<Quote>
<div slot="quote">Power is an illusion of perception.</div>
<div slot="author">Jasnah Kholin, Words of Radiance</div>
</Quote>

And I saved the best of the best for the end. Here is a list of Dalinar's quotes. 
He is my favourite character in the series, so far and I don't think he will be replaced anytime soon.
In you ask me after the "The Way of Kings" probably I will say Kaladin, 
but I think Dalinar's backstory and his character development and growth are so much more interesting.

> Sometimes the prize is not worth the costs. The means by which we achieve victory are as important as the victory itself.

<Quote>
<div slot="quote">Sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a man in the process of changing.</div>
</Quote>

> Yes, I began my journey alone, and I ended it alone. But that does not mean that I walked alone.

> But if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That failure becomes our destination.
> The most important word a man can say are, ‘I will do better.‘ 

<Quote>
<div slot="quote">‘I will take responsibility for what I have done,’ Dalinar whispered. ‘If I must fall, I will rise each time a better man.‘</div>
</Quote>

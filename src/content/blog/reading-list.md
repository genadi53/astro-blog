# **What am I currently reading?**

I startefd reading books when I was maybe in the second or third grade. Before that it was my mom who would read to me.
Also I was "reading" comics and illustated books on my own even earlier. My love for comics is something that stayed with me to this day.
Then I was reading <strong>"Donald Duck"</strong> and <strong>"Mickey Mouse"</strong> comics. Now I read enjoy reading weekly manga and manhwa on the internet. Then

Anyways, I moving into the "serious" books. Lately, I read books primarily from the following genres: 
<ol>
<li>Fantasy</li>
<li>Science Fiction</li>
<li>Historical Fiction</li>
<li>Mystery</li>     
<li>Crime and Thrillers</li>
<li>History</li>     
</ol>

So don't judge if my reading list is filled with "fantasy" and "science fiction" books.
I don't really get new recomendations for other genres, and for the latest fantasy news I visit

Not a paid promotion xD.  


For this year I have decided to read the following books and series:

- [ ] <strong>The First Law Trilogy</strong> by Joe Abercrombie - My favorite grim dark fantasy series. Probaly the first on this list, that I will complete. 
  Already bought all of them and now they are waiting for me.
  - [x] The Blade Itself
  - [ ] Before They are Hanged
  - [ ] Last Argument of Kings
- [x] <strong>The Gentelmen Basterds</strong> by Scott Lynch - I have read parts of the first book on my phone and it was really good, but I want to buy the paper version and read the rest of the series yet. 
- [ ] <strong>The Poppy War</strong> by R.F.Kuang - Heard some good things about this book, but I haven't read it yet. On Facebook, I read some negative things about it, so I'm a bit sceptical about it.
- [ ] Any <strong>Malazan</strong> books by Steven Erikson and Ian C. Esslemont - Still confused about the order of the books, I bought the first one Empire Night of Knives (Novels of the Malazan), but I didn't start it yet, because it was not the first book in the series. Later I started reading Gardens of the Moon (The Malazan Book of the Fallen) on my phone, and its ok, but probably will finish it on paper. Currently I haven't a decided if I really want to read the series.    
- [ ] <strong>Stormlight Archive</strong> by Brandon Sanderson - This is the series I've been waiting for. The reason for this list. My favorite all time series, really only the "Whell of Time" can challange. Soooooo hyped for the Wind and Truth, waithing to be rellated after 2 months for Chistmas, then I will buy both of them. I have read Rythm of War on my phone just to see what was happening, because I didn't want to wait for the new publishing. If you somehow didn't catch it, I love this series. #1 in my list for 69 weeks xD.
  - [ ] Rythm of War
  - [ ] Wind and Truth
- [ ] <strong>The Bloodsworn Saga</strong> by John Gwynne - "Shadow of the Gods" is probably the book with the best art in my collection. Really liked the first book, but I haven't read the rest, waithing to be translated and published.
  The word is amazing, cool spin on the norse mythology. Love the characters, Orka gives Dalinar run for his money, for badass fighters, Varg also is cool, but I don't vibe with Elvar. Still one of th most interesting books I've read this year, definitely will read the rest.
  - [x] Shadow of the Gods
  - [ ] Hunger of the Gods
  - [ ] Fury of the Gods
- [ ] <strong>The Green Bone Saga</strong> by Fonda Lee - really hyped about this series, but I haven't read the first book yet but all I have heard is good things about it. Super excited, and hope it delivers.
  - [ ] Jade City
- [ ] <strong>Witcher Series</strong> by Andrzej Sapkowski - I have read the first book on my phone and it was really good, but I want to buy the paper version and read the rest of the series yet. PS. Love the third game and CD Project Red :>. 
- [ ] <strong>The Sword of Kaigen</strong> by M.L.Wang 
- [ ] <strong>The Will of the Many</strong> by James Islington - Really hyped on BookTube, everyone say that is great and top 10 alltime. Started it on my phone and read only one chapter and now I don't even remember what it was about. 
  Probably will read some more and wait for the translation.

### Some sci-fi series
- [ ] <strong>The Sun Eather Series</strong> by Christopher Ruocchio - Started Empire of Silence (the first entry in the series) on my phone and enjoyed some parts of it, 
  but probably won't read the whole book unless it's translated or on a paperback. Also, recomended by Daniel Greene.
- [ ] <strong>The Murderbot Diaries</strong> by Matha Wells
- [ ] <strong>Silo</strong> by Hugh Howey
- [ ] <strong>Red Rising</strong> by Pierce Brown

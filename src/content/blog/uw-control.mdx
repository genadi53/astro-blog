# **How it started**

<br />

I started playing Magic the Gathering when I was around 10 years old. The first cart that I can remember was a <ImageHoverCard client:load image={"/mtg/goblin-war-wagon.jpg"} stylesTrigger="text-orange-500" >"Goblin War Wagon"</ImageHoverCard>,
that was given to me by my mom. It was given to her as a sample with card with instructions on how to play the game, when she was one of Sofia Book Fairs. I
quickly learned the rules and started playing with my friends. The I forgot about the game for few years, but started playing again around 2013. The
"Theros" set was freshly relased, and I purched starting deck called <a style="color: #fb923c" href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Theros/Intro_packs#Blazing_Beasts_of_Myth">"Blazing Beasts of Myth"</a>,
because at the time I liked big green monsters. This deck was really bad, but I was a bit of a newbie at the time, so I didn't know how that. I started
reading and watching all Mtg videos and articles, that I can found on the internet. I dont't remember how, but I stumbled on this legendary match (MagicProTour Finals 2015 - Ivan Floch vs. Jackson Cunningham).

And there it is. When I saw the power of grinding your opponent to dust, I knew what I want to play. And also I really like <ImageHoverCard client:load image={"/mtg/elspeth-sun-s-champion.jpg"} stylesTrigger="text-orange-500">"Elspeth, Sun's Champion"</ImageHoverCard>.
To this day, this is one of my favorite planeswalkers. In combination with "Teferi, Hero of Dominaria".
I really got into Magic whit the relase of "Dominaria" set, and the with the introduction of the mobile app "Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2015".
Later I switched to MtG Arena, and now I play almost every day.

# **UW Control**

<br />
Now I have played countless hours of UW Control, first when it was a Standart menace, and now in Pioneer. I never have really tried playing Modern, there the deck is not what I like, because of the format speed.
I enjoy playing the deck version in Pioneer, where all my favorite card are legal and have some meta relevance. 
There are not enogh word to descibe the feeling of slamming Teferi on an empty board, plus it and then <ImageHoverCard client:load image={"/mtg/dovins-veto.jpg"} stylesTrigger="text-orange-500">veto</ImageHoverCard> the opponent's next play.
<br />

UW Control rewards patience and precise decision-making, which is exactly why I gravitated towards it. 
The longer the game goes, the more I feel in control (pun intended), and this feeling of inevitability is what makes this archetype so thrilling for me. 
Knowing that you can outlast your opponent and turn their aggression into wasted energy is incredibly satisfying.
While many cards make UW Control what it is, some stand out as personal favoritesâ€”ones that define the deck for me. Aside from the obvious powerhouses like "Teferi, Hero of Dominaria" here are a few that always feel special when they are in my hand:
<br />

- <ImageHoverCard client:load image={"/mtg/supreme-verdict.jpg"} stylesTrigger="text-orange-500">Supreme Verdict</ImageHoverCard> - the ultimate sweeper. Knowing that your opponent has no way to stop this uncounterable wrath is so good. It is the reset button that have saved me from countless hopeless board states. 
Notable Mention to goes to the one of Settle the Wreckage to catch off guar you opponent.
<br />
- <ImageHoverCard client:load image={"/mtg/absorb.jpg"} stylesTrigger="text-orange-500">Absorb</ImageHoverCard> - countering a spell is good, but also gaining life to stabilize - nice. In a control deck, every point of life can count, and Absorb gives you that little cushion to stabilize.
<br />
- <ImageHoverCard client:load image={"/mtg/dovins-veto.jpg"} stylesTrigger="text-orange-500">Dovin's Veto</ImageHoverCard> - this is the best card versus any control matchup, and rightly so. Its ability to stop noncreature spells without any possibility of being countered is a huge advantage in mirrors
 or when facing off against strategies that rely on key noncreature spells to win the game.
<br />
- <ImageHoverCard client:load image={"/mtg/no-more-lies.jpg"} stylesTrigger="text-orange-500">No More Lies</ImageHoverCard> - newest toy in the box. It is a great counterspell to get out of trouble early. Later in the game it is's not ideal, but it is still a ok. Having a Mana Leak in Standart also was a huge deal.
Realy like it and probably this is auto include 4 copies in future UW decks.  

<br />
- <ImageHoverCard client:load image={"/mtg/shark-typhoon.jpg"} stylesTrigger="text-orange-500">Shark Typhoon</ImageHoverCard> - cycling this to create a chimp blocker or a massive flying shark to finish the game is great. 
Also in grindier midrange matchups can be game winner if the cannot answer the enchantment. It is very cool and flexible card, giving you value in both casting and modes.

<br />
- <ImageHoverCard client:load image={"/mtg/memory-deluge.jpg"} stylesTrigger="text-orange-500">Memory Deluge</ImageHoverCard> - the current best 'dig' spell. It finds you the cards you need in the early and late game. Casting it for the Flashback cost mostly mean that you can win the game.    

<br />
- <ImageHoverCard client:load image={"/mtg/wandering-emperor.jpg"} stylesTrigger="text-orange-500">The Wandering Emperor</ImageHoverCard> - really like the design of this card. Planeswalker that can bee played on instant speed is a great and helps you to get out of trouble and stabilize the board. Also can be used to make a board and win the game. 

<br />
# **Conclusion**
Playing control isn't for everyone. Some people find it slow or boring, but for me, it is a form of art. The satisfaction of gradually locking your opponent out of the game, anticipating and predicting their next move,
and knowing that no matter what they do, you're ready - that is why I keep coming back to this archetype. When playing UW Control every decision can have ripple effects across the game. 
Whether it's a well-timed counterspell or a perfectly planned board wipe, every move matters. If you enjoy strategy, patience, and mastering your deck, this is the deck for you.
For me, it's where I find the most joy in Magic the Gathering.

# **How it started**

<br />

I started playing Magic the Gathering when I was around 10 years old. The first cart that I can remember was a <ImageHoverCard client:load image={"/mtg/goblin-war-wagon.jpg"} stylesTrigger="text-orange-500" >"Goblin War Wagon"</ImageHoverCard>,
that was given to me by my mom. It was given to her as a sample with card with instructions on how to play the game, when she was one of Sofia Book Fairs. I
quickly learned the rules and started playing with my friends. The I forgot about the game for few years, but started playing again around 2013. The
"Theros" set was freshly relased, and I purched starting deck called <a style="color: #fb923c" href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Theros/Intro_packs#Blazing_Beasts_of_Myth">"Blazing Beasts of Myth"</a>,
because at the time I liked big green monsters. This deck was really bad, but I was a bit of a newbie at the time, so I didn't know how that. I started
reading and watching all Mtg videos and articles, that I can found on the internet. I dont't remember how, but I stumbled on this legendary match (MagicProTour Finals 2015 - Ivan Floch vs. Jackson Cunningham).

And there it is. When I saw the power of grinding your opponent to dust, I knew what I want to play. And also I really like <ImageHoverCard client:load image={"/mtg/elspeth-sun-s-champion.jpg"} stylesTrigger="text-orange-500">"Elspeth, Sun's Champion"</ImageHoverCard>.
To this day, this is one of my favorite planeswalkers. In combination with "Teferi, Hero of Dominaria".
I really got into Magic whit the relase of "Dominaria" set, and the with the introduction of the mobile app "Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2015".
Later I switched to MtG Arena, and now I play almost every day.

<br />
Now I have played countless hours of UW Control, first when it was a Standart menace, and now in Pioneer. I never have really tried playing Modern, there the deck is not what I like, because of the format speed.
I enjoy playing the deck version in Pioneer, where all my favorite card are legal and have some meta relevance. 
There are not enogh word to descibe the feeling of slamming Teferi on an empty board, plus it and then <ImageHoverCard client:load image={"/mtg/dovins-veto.jpg"} stylesTrigger="text-orange-500">veto</ImageHoverCard> the opponent's next play.
